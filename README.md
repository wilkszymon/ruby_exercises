Simple ruby exercises 

1. caesar_cipher -> takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string, for example

2. substrings -> takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. 
It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
